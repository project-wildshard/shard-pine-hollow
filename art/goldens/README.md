# Goldens: pine-hollow

> Written by: Claude (opus-k9, REPO-KIT K9, 2026-11-11). Carried from singleplayer `art/shardfile-goldens/` and
> `art/legacy-goldens/` (`08e4a21f69`). Jake, 2026-11-11 (J273): "goldens has to go into each major shard".

The look to hold for `pine-hollow`: 24 cameras. The skill `goldens` runs them; the rules are engine `docs/goldens.md`.

- `shardfile/<nn>-<camera>.jpg`: the SHARDFILE goldens (G859, G873 L5), 22 px label strip on top.
- `legacy/<nn>-<camera>.jpg`: the frozen LEGACY record (10-28, G843). Never re-captured, never updated.
- `cameras24.json`: this shard's 24 cameras (eye, yaw, pitch, FOV, probe), the `pine-hollow` entry of engine
  `scripts/perf/cameras24.json`.
- `runs/<date>-<sha10>-board.jpg`: the rerun board (<= 500 KB) a look change lands with.
